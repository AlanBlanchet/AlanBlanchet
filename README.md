Hello there, I'm Alan Blanchet an AI engineer currently working at Neovision.

I'm always working on something üî®
I love to learn EVERYTHING related to computer science üñ•Ô∏è. 

I've been through making electronic circuit. Working out how to build complex pattern with transistors ‚ö° <br>
I've been going through low level programming languages. Learning about bitwise operations, assembly, low level optimisations...<br>
I used my skills to work on cybersecurity subjects, use popular linux utilities...<br>
I then proceeded to learn all about AI. From simple Linear Regressions to understanding how gradients in DNN work, why we use certain layers or not.<br>
I'm now very confident in my AI learning and manage to understand high level concepts like for CNNs, Transformers and lots of other model architectures.<br>

I purposely [made a repository](https://github.com/AlanBlanchet/AI-4-Alan) to gather all my work on AI and other.

My most precious skill is to always not rely on what people tell me or what scientific papers say.<br>
I always require to challenge subjects in order to fully understand and judge them.<br>
Learning all these skills makes me really comfortable with understanding and developing from the electricity fundamentals to popular Machine Learning applications üìö<br>

I want to use my knowledge to make our world better üåç
