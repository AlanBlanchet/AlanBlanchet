Hello there, I'm Alan Blanchet an AI engineer currently working at Neovision.

I'm always working on something 🔨
I love to learn EVERYTHING related to computer science 🖥️. 

I've been through making electronic circuit. Working out how to build complex pattern with transistors ⚡
I've been going through low level programming languages. Learning about bitwise operations, assembly, low level optimisations...
I used my skills to work on cybersecurity subjects, use popular linux utilities...
I then processeded to learn all about AI. From simple Linear Regressions to understanding how gradients in DNN work, why we use certain layers or not.

My most precious skill is to always not rely on what people tell me or what scientific papers say.
I always require to challenge subjects in order to fully understand and judge them.
Learning all these skills makes me really comfortable with understanding and developing from the electricity fundamentals to popular Machine Learning applications 📚

I want to use my knowledge to make our world better 🌍
